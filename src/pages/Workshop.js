            The New Mind workshop series consists of <b>5 engaging sessions</b> designed to introduce essential skills for conducting LLM-related research and open up topics from the field to inspire interdisciplinary research. Below is the list of all 5 topics and brief descriptions of what to expect.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3>Session 1: <span style={{ color: 'purple' }}>Can Machines Think?</span></h3>
            <p>
              Session 1 opens up the floor for discussing the concept of intelligence, both natural and artificial, and challenge traditional notions of thinking and learning as known across language and cognition sciences. We explore biases stemming from these traditional definitions as well as new ways of looking at the concepts.
            </p>

            <h3>Session 2: <span style={{ color: 'purple' }}>Origins of AI-Generated Language</span></h3>
            <p>
              Session 2 offers beginner-friendly insights into how LLMs work on the technical level, exposes differences between learning and memorisation, and fosters critical thinking about the relationship between language and computation.
            </p>

            <h3>Session 3: <span style={{ color: 'purple' }}>Common Failures and (Mis)Alignment</span></h3>
            <p>
                Session 3 introduces the key difficulties in creating aligned LLM systems and agents. In this session, participants get to understand what kinds of problems AI systems find challenging, discuss the consequences of uninterpretable and unexplainable AI, and see why unresolved questions can quickly become rather large-scale problems.
            </p>

            <h3>Session 4: <span style={{ color: 'purple' }}>Mitigating Risk</span></h3>
            <p>
              Session 4 offers insights into various approaches to AI safety (e.g., mech-interp, governance, adversarial testingâ€¦), gives participaants the opportunity to see examples of success in AI safety research, and lays out the dilemma of balancing performace and safety of AI systems.
 
            </p>

            <h3>Session 5: <span style={{ color: 'purple' }}>Interdisciplinary Research and Safe AI</span></h3>
            <p>
            Session 5 highlights the necessity of interdisciplinary expertise for addressing the complexity of LLMs, explores methods from language and cognition sciences to enhance AI safety, and provides strategies for effective interdisciplinary communication and peer review.
            </p>

            <h3>Final Event: <span style={{ color: 'purple' }}>Research Question Incubator</span></h3>
            <p>
            Research Question Incubator is designed as a day-long hackathon-style event aimed to bring in participants and mentors of a variety of backgrounds and encourage them to contribute their unique expertise to developm innovation-oriented interdisciplinary research projects that will help communities in Philadelphia and around the world.
